# HN Nucleares Dashboard

This project is a hobby dashboard for the game Nucleares.
It is limited by the data exposed by the game, and my will to continue developing it.

The diagrams inside are entirely hand crafted in code in 100x100 blocks around the origin.
They are then used with transform to where they are needed.

# Disclaimer

I am not a graphic designer.
It may not work for you.
There will be bugs, that may not bother me and never be fixed.
You many use or change it as you wish.

2. Start the game and start the game webserver.
3. Open the HTML directly in your web browser, place on your second monitor.
